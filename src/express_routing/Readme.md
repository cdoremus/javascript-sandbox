# Routing using the Express Library and TypeScript
This folder holds TypeScript code demoing how to do routing with the Node [Express](https://expressjs.com/) library.

Install dependencies using the `yarn` or `npm install`
commands.

Start the server using `yarn start` or `npm start`

Once the server is started, browse to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can run the server in watch mode using `yarn watch` or `npm run watch`.

This demos the following ways to do routing:
* Route static resources from a 'public' folder.
* Routing templated content using the Express EJS view engine.
* Routing using a URL with a query string parameter.
* Using a POST request to submit a form.
* Using a GET request to obtain JSON response.
* Routing with URL parameters.
