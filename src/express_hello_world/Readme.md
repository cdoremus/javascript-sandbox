# Node Hello World using the Express Library #
This folder holds JavaScript (js folder) and TypeScript (ts folder) examples of the basic use of the Express library to create a simple web server.

Both Javascript and TypeScript versions require you to install dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
The TypeScript code will need to be transpiled to JavaScript. To do that you will need to invoke the following command in the ts folder
```bash
npm run build
```
To run the application, invoke this command in either the js or ts folder:
```bash
node index.js
```
Once node starts the server, you can browse to
<a href="http://localhost:3000/hello">http://localhost:3000/hello</a>.
